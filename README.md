# UAThorns

This collection of thorns, developed at the University of Arizona, includes:
* IllinoisGRMHD - a modified version of the publicly available GRMHD thorn which is compatible with tabulated, finite temperature equations of state.
* ID_converter_ILGRMHD - a version of the publicly available thorn which converts HydroBase fluid variables to those internally used by IllinoisGRMHD
* ConservativeToPrimitive - a thorn which drives the conservative-to-primitive routines used in tabulated-EOS-compatible version of IllinoisGRMHD.
* UA_EOS_Omni - a modified version of the publicly available equation of state driver thorn (EOS_Omni) used within the EinsteinToolkit. 
* Meudon_Bin_NS - a modified version of the Muedon_Bin_NS thorn which allows for the import of binary neutron star initial data built using tabulated, finite temperature equations of state.

Note               : Convert HydroBase variables to 
                     IllinoisGRMHD-compatible variables. Used 
                     for compatibility with HydroBase/ADMBase
                     initial data thorns in the Einstein 
                     Toolkit. This thorn has been modified from
                     the version oackaged within the EinsteinToolkit

1. Purpose

IllinoisGRMHD and HydroBase variables are incompatible;
The former uses 3-velocity defined as v^i = u^i/u^0, and
the latter uses the Valencia formalism definition of v^i.

Define the Valencia formalism's definition of v^i to be 
"W^i", and IllinoisGRMHD's definition "v^i"
Then

W^i = (v^i + \beta^i) / (\alpha). (Eq 11 in 
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.07276.pdf).

Similarly,

v_i = (\alpha) W^i  - \beta^i

In addition, IllinoisGRMHD needs the A-fields to be 
defined on *staggered* grids, and HydroBase does not yet
support this option. The staggerings are defined in 
Table 1 of the IllinoisGRMHD code announcement paper:
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.07276.pdf (page 15).

The long-term goal should be to deprecate this thorn.

This thorn has been modified to allow for initialization of 
ID using finite-temperature EOS tables, and is compatible
with the version of IllinoisGRMHD which has been updated
by Pedro Espino.

This Thorn provides a one-fits-all EOS handler.
All EOS are actually implemented right inside this single
thorn without crazy interfaces and lots of function calls.

eoskey controls the type of EOS being used:

eoskey:

1 --- polytropic EOS
2 --- gamma-law EOS
3 --- hybrid EOS
4 --- finite-T microphysical NSE EOS


keyerr settings:

-1 -- called EOS routine with keytemp=1, but
      routine does not allow such a call

This thorn has been modified for better compatibility with 
the ConservativeToPrimitive thorn and for increased robustness
when using some C2P algorithms.
